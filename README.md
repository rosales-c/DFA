# DFA
A DFA for how many numbers are weakly divisible by 7. Input is number of digits. Weakly divisible by 7 means that a number is naturally divisible by 7 or if you remove a digit it becomes divisible by 7. Ex: 141 is not divisible by 7, but removing the last 1 will make it 14 which is weakly divisible by 7.
